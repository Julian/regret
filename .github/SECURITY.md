# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, only the latest released ``regret`` version is supported
and will receive updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to
``Julian+Security@GrayVines.com`` with subject line ``SECURITY
(regret)``.

I will do my best to respond within 48 hours to acknowledge the message
and discuss further steps.

If the vulnerability is accepted, an advisory will be sent out via
GitHub's security advisory functionality.

For non-sensitive discussion related to this policy itself, feel free to
open an issue on the issue tracker.
